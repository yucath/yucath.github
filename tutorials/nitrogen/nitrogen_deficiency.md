# Nitrogen Deficiency

Nitrogen is necessary for many tree functions, including growth, 
fruit bud formation, fruit set and fruit size. Because of the complexity
 of nitrogen interactions with quality and production, the best guide 
for nitrogen rates is leaf analysis.

**Identification**

- Usually first appears on older leaves,
- Leaves turn light green or yellow as nitrogen is relocated from older, less productive leaves to the newest growth,
- The bark of shoots and twigs may become reddish in colour and shoot growth is spindly,
- If the deficiency is prolonged, older leaves become orange to reddish in colour and may drop prematurely,
- Fruit bud formation and fruit set may be restricted,
- Fruit is small and highly coloured and yields will be reduced.
- Terminal shoot growth of less than 20 cm on bearing trees
and less than 40 cm on non-bearing trees may indicate a nitrogen
deficiency
