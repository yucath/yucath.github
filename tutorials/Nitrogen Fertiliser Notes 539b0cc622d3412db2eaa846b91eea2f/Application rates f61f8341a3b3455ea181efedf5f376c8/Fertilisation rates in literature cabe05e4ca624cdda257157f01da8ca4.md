# Fertilisation rates in literature

Older trees mayhave a somewhat higher N content, butmaximum tree size is often reached byyear 6 in high-density apple plantings.Recommended annual rates of N appli-cation for young dwarf apple trees rangefrom 80 to 160 lb/acre (88 to 176kg·ha–1) (Okanagan Valley Tree FruitAuthority, 1993) indicating a large po-tential oversupply when compared withactual tree uptake.
