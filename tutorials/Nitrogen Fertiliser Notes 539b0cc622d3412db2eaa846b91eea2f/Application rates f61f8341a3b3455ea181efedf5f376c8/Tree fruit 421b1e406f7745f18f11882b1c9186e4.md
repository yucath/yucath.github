*Use the lower end of the range in mature orchards with small amounts of pruning and where pruning material is recycled. Consider higher ends of the range in weak sites, limited areas, and when leaf N shows deficiency.*

For P and K, due to their recycling process and mobility, the dose can be calculated directly with the demand (Dose = Demand) when levels in the soil are adequate.

For micronutrients (Cu, Zn, S, Mn, Fe, and B) the requirements are very small (grams per acre) and normally foliar fertilization is best when leaf analysis or visual symptoms indicate (note: annually for Zn and B). However, it is important to keep adequate levels in the soil as some nutrients are required in the root zone for growth development and signaling (see *Example 1* for more details).

***Example 1. Calculating demand based on production.***

Apple production of 80 bin/acre = 37 ton/acre.

N demand: (Based on Table 3)

37 tons × (1.9 to 2.2 lb of N) = 70 to 80 lb/acre.37 tons × 0.4 lb of P = 15 lb/acre.37 tons × (3.6 to 4.7 lb of K) = 133 to 174 lb/acre.
